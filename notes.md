# Notes

A big part of your probability has to do with *position*, i.e if you don't have enough trumps to pull the right bower then the left bower will always lose -- even if it beats 50 other cards. 

I think mathematically, playing nitty, power cards are worth way more, especially if you aren't in pole position.
